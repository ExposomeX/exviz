Description: For the data visualization of different statistical and biological analysis in a user friendly and easy way, 
    including four typical classes of visualization.The visualization of the high dimension data is also very useful for 
    the users in the field.The data visualization of different statistical analysis as well as the biological interaction 
    can save much time for the data interpretation. Here, we mainly classify all the visualization task into four types,
    including category (distinguishing the characteristics of various groups), relationship (statistical relationship 
    between various features), distribution (the distribution characters of the single or multiple factors), 
    and components (the inclusion relationship between the part components and the whole).
